				Ruby - Arrays and Hashes
				</td>

				ts been a few weeks since I last saw/did some Ruby programming so I was definitely a bit rusty. Like any language, once you stop using it you forget it. At the same time with a little bit of effort its also like riding a bicycle and comes back. Funny how the human brain works right? Anyways for this blog post I will discuss the topic of Arrays and Hashes.

 

An array is basically a collection of ordered elements in Ruby. The collection can be made up of strings(letters/words), integers(whole numbers ie 5), floats(numbers with a decimal 5.3) and Booleans (true/false values). An array can be made up of any of these elements and don’t have to all be the same type of element. Here are some examples of arrays.

 

numbers = [4, 6, 19, 22, 5, 3, 100]]

 

vowels = [a, e, i, o, u]

 

fast_food_items = [burgers, fries, shakes, nuggets]

 

mixed_array = [33, a, burgers, shakes, 2]

 

 

 

Like arrays, hashes are also a collection of elements in Ruby, however they belong to key-value pairs. Each element is assigned a key and a value. Here are some examples of hashes.

 

Sports_Cars = {

“Scion” => “FR-S”

“Nissan” => “370z”

“BMW” => “Z4”

“Ford” => “Mustang”

“Chevrolet => “Corvette”
