        Benefits of Version Control

          Version is extremely helpful for developrs. It allows developrs to easily revert back to previous versions of code. By doing this developrs are able to more easily find bugs or fix issues or mistakes that may take place along the way. It works almost like a snapshot in time!

          Git helps developrs keep track of these changes. It offers the ability to insert comments on what exactly was changed of modified so developrs can easily see what, why, and how things were changed.

          Github is useful for two big reasons. First it is a remote location for code and files to be saved/stored. This is tremendously helpful because you never know when your local system may fail. By having your code stored remotely it is helps revent the loss of important code and serves as a backup.

          The second reason Github is helpful is that it enables multiple developrs and users to be able to access, modify/edit, and work on the same code. Through Github, you can see who made modifications, when, how and why! When used correctly Github can be a very powerful tool for developrs.
