				What is the difference between margin, border, and padding?

				When spacing and moving objects around on a webpage, the margin and padding are the two most commonly used properties.

				While margin and padding are similar

				A border is the edge of an object. It is the line in which the object/element begins and ends.

				A margin is the area that surrounds an object/element. It is outside of an object/element and is transparent. Its background color cannot be modified or edited, and is measured from the object/element's border on out. Each side of the margin (top,left,right,bottom) can all be modified and measured independently (ie the top margin does not have to be the same size as the bottom margin, etc).

				Padding is the area of an element that is inside of an object/element. It is measured from the border inwards and takes on the color of the object/element. It surrounds the content within the object/element. Like the margin, each side can be modified and measured independently.

				In terms of when to use margin vs padding when spacing objects/elements on a page, I would recommend useing margin when trying to move an entire object/element where as padding would be best served when moving around just the content itself once you have finalized the placement of the object/element.

				Margin and Padding both extremely useful when placing and moving objects/elements around on a webpage. I hope you now have a better understanding of the difference between margin and padding.
