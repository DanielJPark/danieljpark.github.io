<p>About Me</p>
<p>
My name is Dan Park. I was born and raised in the Philadelphia area.
I graduated from Temple University with a degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing. After college I went on to earn my Teacher's Certification and taught Middle School and High School Computer Technology and Business electives. After 10 years in education and teaching basic technology courses, I have decided to shift gears in my career and become a web devloper.
</p>
<p>
Some of my hobbies include TV Shows, Movies, Comics, Music, and Sports. All of these things relate to one of my biggest quirks. I am a bit of collector and a completionist. What I mean by that is when I collect something I MUST have every single version. For example, I used to collect Sneakers. When I was collecting shoes I NEEDED to have every version of every style. When I collected comics I used to follow a particular artist by the name of Jim Lee. I was obsessed with owning every single book he worked on regardless of rarity or value.
