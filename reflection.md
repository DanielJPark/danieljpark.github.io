What did you learn about CSS positioning?
	
	CSS positioning can be tricky. In theory it is pretty simple, but I found myself struggling with it a bit. 

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
	
	CSS Positioning was very difficult for me. I struggled with finding the exact id, classes, and code to get things to move the way I wanted to.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

	I learned about classes and ids. It is helpful because it allows you to edit several things on several pages all at once, instead of having to go line item by line item if all the formatting was done in the HTML code itself.
