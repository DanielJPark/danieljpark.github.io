1. How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

	Great! I enjoyed pairing with Dexter. It was refreshing to be able to share ideas and concepts with another student. I feel that it gave me opportunties to learn small details here and there that I otherwise would not have picked up on.

2. Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

	Yes, I feel that it was very helpful in giving a sense of direction to the code. Without the wireframe I feel that writing HTML code could get disorganized and lack general direction.

3. What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

	Keeping things simple. We didn't want to over complicate the design of the blog page. 

4. What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

	I learned how to use the div tags, a footer tag, as well as H1, H2, H3, etc tags.
